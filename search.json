Retiring with the NFL record for Passing Yards, Passing Touchdowns, Passing Yards, Completion Percentage, and the most 5,000+ yard seasons in NFL history. He had also won a Super Bowl and won a couple Offensive Player of the Year Awards; but the one thing Brees never got in his illustrious career was an MVP. He had no better argument for MVP more than the 2010-2011 NFL season.

Brees statistically was the best QB statistically this year, he was number one in passing yards where Rodgers was fifth in the league this year. Brees was also number one in passing Touchdowns where Rodgers was second. Aaron Rodgers did have a great year as well, 15-1 record and that insane TD/Int ratio was crazy, but this should not have been enough to take away the MVP from Brees."
